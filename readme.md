# CSS radios &amp; checkboxes

It is a simple method for customizing checkboxes and radiobuttons.
The method is based on the "for" attribute of the "label" element. If you add for the label the same "for" attribute as the ID of the input, then each time a label is clicked, the input's status will change (the "checked" attribute).

By adding some styles, you can simply change the inputs' looks. You don't need to use any jQuery plugin or JavaScript.
